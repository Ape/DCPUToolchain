Preprocessor
=============================================

The toolchain preprocessor is a fully recursive, queue-based preprocessor.  The preprocessor infrastructure is the
same for all languages, but each language is exposed to a different set of available directives.

.. note::
    
    Preprocessor module directives are only exposed to the assembler.
