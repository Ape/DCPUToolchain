Preprocessor
=============================================

The preprocessor parses and transforms text before it is read in by the compiler or assembler.  In the toolchain we
use the preprocessor for both the compiler infrastructure and the assembler, thus all directives in the preprocessor
are supported in both high-level languages and assembly.
