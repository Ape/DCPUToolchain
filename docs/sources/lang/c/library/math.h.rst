:mod:`math.h` --- Mathematical Functions
=============================================

.. module:: math.h
    :synopsis: Mathematical functionality.

The :mod:`math.h` header defines mathemathical functionality.

It provides a subset of functionality available in the standard C library
that appears on other platforms.

.. note::

    This documentation is not yet complete.  See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdlib/
    for a full list of available functions.

.. note::

    No functions are currently provided in this header as floating-point arithmetic is not yet implemented,
    which is required for either the `float` or `double` types to work.
